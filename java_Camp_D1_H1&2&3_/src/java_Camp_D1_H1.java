	Primitive Data Types:
	
	boolean: Holds True and False values 
	byte: Stores integers of size 8 bit
	char: Stores a character
	double: Double precision floating point
	float: Single precision floating point
	int: Stores a integer
	long: Stores long integer
	short: Stores a short integer

	Non-Primitive Data Types:
	
	Class: a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created
	Interface:  Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, 
	but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract 
	(only method signature, nobody)
	String: An array of characters
	Array: A group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name
	

	Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
	The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
	1. Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. 
	Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java 
	2. Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operation, 
	while primitive types cannot
	3. A primitive type has always value, while non-primitive types can be “NULL”
	4. A primitive type start with a lowercase letter, 
	while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letterThe size of primitive type 
	5. depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
	
	Strings: Store a sequence of characters (text)
	*String values must be surrounded by double quotes (“”)

	PS: The String type is so much used and integrated in Java, that some call it "the special ninth type".
	A String in Java is actually a non-primitive data type, because it refers to an object. 
	The String object has methods that are used to perform certain operations on strings.
